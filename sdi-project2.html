<p> I chose to continue with the Pokemon theme from Project 1. During this bit of code you get to select how many Pokemon you start with, choose if you want to catch more, and battle wild Pokemon. At the end you will see how many Pokemon you have and how much experience you gained. Try battling different Pokemon to gain the most Exp points!</p>
